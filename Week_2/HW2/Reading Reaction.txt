My Reaction:

This is an interesting article giving us the tips of workflow and the important tool used in team work â€” Wireframing. The author talks about five steps: clarify the problem, make use of workflows and sketches, get early feedback, know your tools(such as Omnigraffle), and know your audience. These are all useful suggestions, and I started to think about applying through these steps when working on my projects in the future.
